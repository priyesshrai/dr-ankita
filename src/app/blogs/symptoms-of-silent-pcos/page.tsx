                        Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common health condition that affects many women. While some women experience clear signs like irregular periods or weight gain, others may have what is called silent PCOS. In this condition, the symptoms are not very obvious, and many women may not realize they have it until they face issues with fertility or undergo routine health check-ups. Silent PCOS can still affect health in the long run, which is why understanding its hidden signs is important.
                        <br />
                        Dr. Nikila Reddy, Senior Gynecologist in Hyderabad, explains that even when PCOS does not show visible symptoms, the body gives subtle signals. Recognizing these early can help in getting the right treatment and preventing complications.

                                Silent PCOS refers to cases where the usual symptoms of PCOS are mild or absent. Women may not have irregular cycles, sudden weight gain, or excessive hair growth—the common signs usually linked with PCOS. Instead, the condition quietly develops inside the body, affecting hormonal balance, metabolism, and ovarian health. Because the signs are less noticeable, it is often diagnosed late.

                                Even if the symptoms are not very clear, women with silent PCOS may experience small changes in their body. Some common signs include:

                                Silent PCOS is often missed because the outward symptoms are not strong. A woman may think her cycles are normal and ignore small changes in skin, hair, or weight. Sometimes, PCOS is only detected when a woman finds it difficult to conceive or goes for a routine scan. Blood tests and ultrasound are usually needed to confirm the condition.

                                If you notice subtle changes in your menstrual cycle, sudden acne, hair loss, or find it difficult to manage your weight, it is best to consult a gynecologist. Early diagnosis of PCOS helps in better treatment and lowers the risk of future complications. Lifestyle changes, medications, and proper monitoring can help women manage silent PCOS effectively.
