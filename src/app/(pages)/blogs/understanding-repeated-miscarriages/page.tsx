                        Repeated miscarriages, also called recurrent pregnancy loss, is when a woman has two or more miscarriages. This situation is painful emotionally and physically, and many couples want to understand why it&apos;s happening and what can be done. Dr. Ankita Chauhan, senior gynaecologist in Hyderabad, explains causes, what to look for, and how to move forward with hope.

                                    Recurrent miscarriage is usually defined as two or more pregnancy losses, often before 20 weeks. Some healthcare systems use three losses as the benchmark.
