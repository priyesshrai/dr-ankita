                        Period pain, also called menstrual cramps or dysmenorrhea, is something many women experience every month. Sometimes the pain is mild and manageable. Other times it can be very strong and affect daily life. Dr. Ankita Chauhan, senior gynaecologist in Hyderabad, explains why period pain occurs, what might make it worse, and when to see a doctor.

                                Normal Causes: Why the Uterus Hurts Each Month

                                Every month, the lining of the uterus builds up in preparation for a possible pregnancy. If pregnancy does not happen, this lining sheds. To help shed it, the uterus contracts (tightens) and relaxes. These contractions are driven by substances called prostaglandins, which the uterine lining produces. When prostaglandin levels are high, contractions are stronger, causing more pain. These contractions can also reduce blood flow temporarily, adding to discomfort.
                                <br /><br />
                                This is called primary dysmenorrhea — the usual monthly cramps with no other underlying medical problem. Many women start getting these from a few years after their first period. Usually, the pain is most intense on the first day or two of bleeding and fades afterwards.
